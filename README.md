# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**  
  
* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)  
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!

## The projects and it's functionality:

This project gave me the opportunity to learn and display my knowledge with the difference in display: grid; and display: flex;. This allowed me to understand how to work with different resolutions and it's set up.

## Technology used: 

A lot of the new technologies I got to use are the new lines such as @media screen, display: grid: along with grid-template-(area, columns, rows). I also got to strengthen my BEM knowledge as well as get the opportuniy to mess with transitions for buttons, box-sizing and understanding fonts and how to link them and find them online.
